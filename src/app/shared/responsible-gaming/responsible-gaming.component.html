    <p>Set yourself a deposit limit Before you startto gambling think about how much you can afford to gamble with according to Your financial situation. Play with amounts which are for fun and for Your entertainment</p>

    <p><strong>Minor Protection

    </strong></p>

    <p>Principally we recommend a filter program to avoid minors, especially children, to access any context on the internet, which is not healthy for them.</p>

    <p>For parents we can recommend a list of internet filters, to support them, from keeping their children from any context, which was not made for them: https://famisafe.wondershare.com/internet-filter/best-internet-filters.html</p>

    <p><strong>Self-Exclusion:

    </strong></p>

    <p>In case You are diagnosed with a gambling addiction or try to stay away from gambling for a different reason, we want to assist you to stay away from anything, that does nothing good for you. “Self-Exclusion” means, that You exclude yourself, out
        of Your own choice, from all gambling services. This exclusion cannot be undone for a set amount of time. If you wish to self-exclude yourself from gambling, please message our support and give them a time span between 6 months and 5 years. They
        also will explain you all future steps and what is needed from you.</p>
